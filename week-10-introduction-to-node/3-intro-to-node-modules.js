// NodeJs Module: You can think of a module as a file that has some javascript variables, functions and other logic that you can expose in some other parts of your Node Program.

// There are two different Module Systems in Node:

// 1. Common JS: which uses module.exports to export values and the require() function import values from another module
// 2. ES6 Modules (esm): which uses ES Module System - Import & Export
