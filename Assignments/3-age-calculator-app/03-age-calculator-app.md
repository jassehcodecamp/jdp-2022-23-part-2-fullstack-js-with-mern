<small>Due Date: <strong>8th May, 2023 23:59:59</strong></small>

1. Using React and any styling method/tools of your choice (raw CSS, Bootstrap, etc...), build out this **Age Calculator** app and get it looking as close to this design as possible.

2. Your users should be able to:
   
   1. View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
    
        ![](design/desktop-completed.jpg)
   
   2. Receive validation errors if:
      
      - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
      
      - The day number is **not** between 1-31
      
      - The month number is **not** between 1-12
      
      - The year is in the future
      
      - The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)


      Below are some Form Error scenarious.
