<small>Due Date: <strong>16th June, 2023 23:59:59</strong></small>

1. Using React and Tailwind CSS, build out this **Summary Component** app and get it looking as close to this design as possible.

2. Use the idea of Components to componentize your UI components for a more maintainable and scalable design.

3. Use Tailwind CSS as much as possible, and don't reach out for custom CSS easily. Don't forget to import and use the right fonts, colors, font-sizes, etc

4. The data for the results is provided in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.


5. Your users should be able to:
   1. View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
   
   2. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
