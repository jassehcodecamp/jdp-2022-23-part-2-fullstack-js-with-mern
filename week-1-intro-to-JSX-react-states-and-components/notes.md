## Using & Understanding JSX

- JSX stands for JavaScript Syntax Extension. 
- Unlike HTML JSX is case-sensitive
- Attribute names are written in camelCase
- We can't use reserved javascript words like **for**, **while**, **class**
  - the **class** name attribute in HTML is written className in JSX
  - the **for** attribute in HTML is written as **htmlFor**
- self-closing tags in HTML must have a forward at the end of their tag names.
- we used an expression slot to output JavaScript variables and expressions in JSX
